A simple ToDo app developed with the GLFW3 and Leif libraries, designed to get my feet wet with C programming. This project utilizes OpenGL for rendering the graphical interface, providing a smooth and responsive user experience. The combination of GLFW3 for handling window creation and input, and Leif for layout management, allows for a clean and efficient development process.
